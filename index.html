                    <p>Hi, my name is Ella and I’m a junior at Syracuse University studying <strong>Information Management and Technology</strong> in the iSchool. I intended to concentrate in information security and minor in <strong>Jewelry and Metalsmithing</strong> in the School of Art.</p>
                    <div class="middle">

                    <p>During quarantine I began re-exploring crafts I used to enjoy. I was always good at making friendship bracelets and wanted to learn how to make the kinds with words on them. As I’ve made more, I have become more advanced and I want to share them with the world.</p>
                </div>

           <div class="aboutproduct">
                <h1>About The Products</h1>
                <p>I learned to make friendship braclets at camp. It is a common arts and crafts activity and I always really enjoyed making them. Every summer I would start again. As I got older, I started seeing friendship bracelets with words. I challenged myself to learn how to make those and that’s how I discovered friendship bracelets are a little more complicated than they used to be.</p>
                <h2>Beyond The Friendship Bracelet</h2>
                <p>There are two types of friendship bracelets, normal and alpha. This website is dedicated to my alpha creations, beyond just bracelets. I also make patches for keychains or any type of alpha pattern.</p>
                <p class="caption">*All crafts are made with six-strand divisible Embroidery Floss, 100% cotton. Colors are by <a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/node/20648570011?_encoding=UTF8&field-lbr_brands_browse-bin=LE%20PAON&ref_=bl_dp_s_web_20648570011" target="_blank">LE PAON</a> and may appear different on the web.</p>

                        <h3>Normal</h3>
                        <p class="text">Normal patterns are tied downwards. They can use anywhere from only 1 knot to all 4 knots. When you are making a normal bracelet, the strings change order every time you tie a knot. This means that the "working" strings and "background" strings will also change every so often. Polpular patterns include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Chinese Staircase</li>
                            <li>Candy Stripe</li>
                            <li>Chevron</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <div class="alpha">
                        <h3>Alpha</h3>
                        <p class="text">Alpha bracelets are tied in straight horizontal rows. The only knots used in Alpha bracelets are the forward knot and the backward knot. You alternate entire rows of these 2 knots. So, if your first row is only using a forward knot, then your second row is only using a backward knot, and so on. You substitute in different colors as needed. The cool thing about Alphas is that anything you can draw in a grid, you can make into a bracelet.</p>
